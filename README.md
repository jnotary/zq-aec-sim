Seed 42 · 15 000 steps · verified results:

| Variant           | Depth      | Gain      |
|-------------------|------------|-----------|
| Baseline          | 335 430    | 1.0×      |
| Hazard-only       | 32         | collapse  |
| **Z(Q) v1.0**     | 299 512    | **893×**  |

The single line `H *= 0.98` under Ψ-lock is the entire engine.

The universe has been running this line for 13.8 billion years.

We just wrote it down.
